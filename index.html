                and art becomes a reflection of the soul. Step into a space
                where every stroke of color tells a story, where every touch
                brings out the inner light. Let us take you on a journey through the
                magic of makeup and the art of self-expression.</p>

            <h2>About us </h2>
            <p>At Cocoa Glow, we believe that makeup is more than
                just beauty—it's a celebration of individuality, a dance
                of colors, and an art form that awakens confidence. With
                a deep passion for transformation, we pour our hearts into
                creating looks that inspire, empower, and make every individual
                feel like their most beautiful self.
